# Kwa Ground Vybez Hub

## Project Overview

Kwa Ground Vibes Hub is a community-driven event platform that allows users to submit, discover, and manage local events. Users can create and submit events, which are then reviewed and approved by an admin before being published.

## Features

- **Event Submission:** Users can submit events with details such as title, description, date, time, location, category, and more.
- **Admin Review:** Submitted events require admin approval before they are visible to the public.
- **User Profiles:** Each event is associated with a user profile, allowing users to track the status of their events.
- **Email Notifications:** The system sends email notifications to admins for new event submissions and to users when their events are approved (using Supabase Edge Functions and the Resend API).
- **Event Discovery:** Approved events are displayed for all users to browse and search.
- **Favorites:** Users can save their favorite events for easy access later.
- **Sharing:** Events can be shared easily via generated shareable links.
- **Modern UI:** Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user experience.
